## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Requirements
- Must use Rails 7.0.x, Ruby 3.2.2
- Must use PostgreSQL
- All code must be tested via feature tests and model tests, respectively
- Must use GitHub branching, team code reviews via GitHub PR comments, and either GitHub Projects or a project management tool of your group's choice (Trello, Notion, etc.)
- Must include a thorough README to describe the project
   - README should include a basic description of the project, a summary of the work completed, and some ideas for a potential contributor to work on/refactor next. Also include the names and GitHub links of all student contributors on your project. 
- Must deploy completed code to the internet (using Heroku or Render)
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment is not allowed
- Use of scaffolding is not allowed
- Any gems added to the project must be approved by an instructor
  - Pre-approved gems are `capybara, pry, faker, factory_bot_rails, orderly, simplecov, shoulda-matchers, launchy`

## Phases

1. [Database Setup](./doc/db_setup.md)
1. [User Stories](./doc/user_stories.md)
1. [Extensions](./doc/extensions.md)

## Team Description
README should include a basic description of the project, a summary of the work completed, and some ideas for a potential contributor to work on/refactor next. Also include the names and GitHub links of all student contributors on your project. 

1. This project creates a webpage that tracks online transactions between customers and merchants with their invoices and the items they are purchasing. We completed all but User Story #18 and creating a deployable website. We could refactor by creating more partials, formating HTML websites.
